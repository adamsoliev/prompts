### Learning [^1][^2]
```
I'd like to learn {topic} - becoming an expert and {concrete outcome}.

I've been very successful using Math Academy to learn mathematics.

Using the approach outlined in https://www.justinmath.com/files/the-math-academy-way.pdf, generate a learning system for me to approach this topic.

In particular, Math Academy relies on a dependency graph of exercises to teach you the material. For {topic}, this process is not well known ahead of time, or at least is not well articulated.

Pay special attention to "state changes" that change internal state, and the triggers that switch them.

Go deep into any public resources, such as {concrete relevant resources}, or any other resources that you find related to {topic}.
```

### Code optimization [^3]
```
Your task is to analyze the provided {language} code snippet and suggest improvements to optimize its performance. Identify areas where the code can be made more efficient, faster, or less resource-intensive. Provide specific suggestions for optimization, along with explanations of how these changes can enhance the codeâ€™s performance. The optimized code should maintain the same functionality as the original code while demonstrating improved efficiency.
